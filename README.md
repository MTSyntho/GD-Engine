# GD Engine - FNF in GDevelop
This is FNF in GDevelop 5 and it WILL be very E P I C !!!

This is a work in progress but i am working on it and i will be releasing every update I make as well as open-source of course why else am I putting it on github?
I have seen some recreation and I have seen that A.M.C.P Unamed is also working on FNF in GDevelop and I'm pretty sure it will be better than mine but does it look like I care? No i don't
Here is a video he made about it:

Yay! You read all this useless information! Just wanna say will have a bit or alot more feature than the original FNF already has.
To open this you require the latest version of GDevelop 5, when in GD5 open the game.json file.

That is all I have to say, just wait for the release so you can play it.

Used to be called ProjectFNF-GDevelop

Note: The project has gotten a rename due to the fact the name GD Engine is a common name for a Friday Night Funkin' Engines in GDevelop 5
